Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt.
 Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.


When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax),
finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes paid.


Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping baskets.

Input:

1) 1 book at 12.49

3) 1 chocolate bar at 0.85
